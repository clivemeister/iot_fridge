Visualisation of a fridge as an IoT device. Features use of (simulated) blockchain
to handle payments, with a "smart contract" on the blockchain holding money in escrow
against a service being completed.  Includes a simulated App which allows an
Uber-style model of fridge replenishment, with subscribers notified when a fridge
is getting low, and being paid a small fee (the "bounty") when they complete the 
restocking.  Also features some smart machine-learning style replenishment algorithms
that look at recent consumption as a guide to future consumption, and restock the 
most popular lines.  Finally, has a visualisation of a blockchain, with "hashes"
appearing on the active block of the blockchain as transactions happen,  Locally
originated transactions have their hash written in red, as a discussion point.

When run on a Raspberry Pi with the appropriate sensor connected as a I2C device, 
it can show actual temperatures from the sensor; otherwise, it shows simulated 
temperatures.
